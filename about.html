                    <h5>A little bit about me and how I got here:</h5>
                    <p>I am Sarah, a UX/UI Designer based in Denver, Colorado. My education background consists of web application integration, graphic design, and UX/UI design. My professional experience includes working as a technical consultant and graphic/digital designer. By combining both my interests of technology and design, I finally found my sweet spot: UX design.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        During my experience as a technical consultant, I learned how difficult inefficient and poorly designed applications could be for productivity. I often found myself researching creative solutions to save time, energy, and money, but continued to feel the same frustrations as my clients had with no ‚Äúgreat‚Äù solutions to offer. Understanding the human experience is essential for creating useful and effective products. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I enjoy using my skills to help people accomplish their goals and make life easier through human-centered designs. I strive for endless opportunities for learning, collaboration, and continue to push the envelope in order to pursue my journey to become the best designer I can be. Outside of UX, you can find me watching Game of Thrones, hiking, and playing with my new puppy, Bella.</p>
